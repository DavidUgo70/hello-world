# hello-world
Literally trying to learn git at 2:30am in the morning because i dont want to face my java programming schedule i placed on myself but at least i am learning something relating to my job so i guess that is a win for me. I dont know what team i would be on but i hope that whatever team it is, i would be able to give a 100% and be the best team player i can be.
